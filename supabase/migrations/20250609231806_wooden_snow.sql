  # Fix migration for public registration

  This migration was attempting to create a policy on a non-existent 'users' table.
  Supabase handles user registration through the built-in auth.users table automatically.
  
  Since the original intent was to allow public registration, and Supabase already
  handles this through its auth system, this migration is now a no-op that documents
  the intended functionality.
  
  The actual user registration is handled by:
  1. Supabase Auth API (supabase.auth.signUp)
  2. Built-in auth.users table
  3. RLS policies on user_profiles and user_pets tables
*/

-- No additional SQL needed - Supabase handles public registration automatically
-- through the auth.users table and auth API

-- Verify that our existing tables have proper RLS policies for user registration

  -- Check if user_profiles table exists and has proper policies

  -- Check if user_pets table exists and has proper policies  
  IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'user_pets') THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'user_pets table exists with RLS enabled';
